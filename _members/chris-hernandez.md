Chris received a BS in Genetics and Agronomy in 2014 from Iowa State University, and a PhD in Plant Breeding from Cornell University in 2019 working with [Dr. Michael Mazourek](https://cals.cornell.edu/michael-mazourek){:target="_blank"}.
His PhD work focused on using genomics to improve fruit quality traits in a winter squash breeding program.
Chris then spent three years as a postdoctoral researcher in applied quantitative genetics working with the Louisiana State University rice breeding program under the supervision of [Drs. Adam Famoso](https://www.lsuagcenter.com/profiles/afamoso){:target="_blank"} and [Kelly Robbins](https://cals.cornell.edu/kelly-r-robbins){:target="_blank"}. 

Chris's interests lie in understanding the challenges and opportunities associated with utilizing genomics in breeding. His research
merges traditional breeding and genetics with modern statistical, computation, and genomics tools.
