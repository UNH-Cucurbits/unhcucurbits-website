Chris received a BS in Genetics and Agronomy from Iowa State University, and a PhD in Plant Breeding from Cornell University.
His PhD work focused on using genomics to improve fruit quality traits in a winter squash breeding program.
Chris then spent three years as a postdoctoral researcher in applied quantitative genetics working with the Louisiana State University rice breeding program. 

Chris's interests lie in understanding the challenges and opportunities associated with utilizing genomics in breeding. His research
merges traditional breeding and genetics with modern statistical, computation, and genomics tools.
