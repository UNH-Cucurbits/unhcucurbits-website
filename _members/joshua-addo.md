Joshua received both his Bachelor and Masters of Philosophy degrees in Botany (mycology, plant pathology and soil microbiology) from the University of Ghana. He worked with the Cocoa Research Institute of Ghana, evaluating fungicides for the control of cocoa diseases. 

Here at UNH, Joshua is based in the department of [Agriculture, Nutrition and Foods Systems](https://colsa.unh.edu/agriculture-nutrition-food-systems) as a PhD student. Joshua is working on understanding the mechanisms of resistance to powdery mildew (*Podosphaera xanthii*) and phytophthora fruit rot (*Phytophthora capsici*) in *Cucurbita* spp.  He seeks to contribute to the development of cucurbit varieties with robust resistance to diseases, thereby reducing reliance on chemical fungicides and increasing the sustainability and economic viability of cucurbit production systems.
