# Cucurbit Breeding & Genetics @ University of New Hampshire

Welcome to the UNH Cucurbit Breeding and Genetics Program. Thank you for your interest!

The cucurbit breeding program is led by [Dr. Christopher Hernandez](https://unhcucurbits.org/members/chris-hernandez.html) at the University of New Hampshire. The UNH program conducts breeding efforts in squash, pumpkins, and melons. 

Our research program seeks to understand the genetics of important stakeholder traits such as disease resistance and nutritional quality. Towards this goal, we work on developing and validating new technologies and breeding methods.
