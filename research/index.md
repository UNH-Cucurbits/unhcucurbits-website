Space is a limiting resource for all breeding programs, but especially in breeding cucurbit crops. 
It takes a lot of room to grow cucurbit crops, thereby limiting breeding population size and, as result, genetic gain.
Fortunately, genomics-enabled technologies have matured in the last decade.
Current research in the cucurbit program seeks to evaluate the use of these predictive technologies, as well as refining other breeding methods, for increasing breeding efficiency.

The *Cucurbita* genus is home to a wealth of genetic variation.
Research projects are framed around unlocking this variation through identifying, evaluating, and elucidating the genetics of important stakeholder traits.
Examples of important traits include novel sources of disease resistance, agronomic traits like plant habit, and consumer traits such as nutritional content and flavor.
Once identified, these traits are moved into elite germplasm and made available through licensing to breeding companies and research collaborators world-wide.
