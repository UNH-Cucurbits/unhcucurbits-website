#### Program policies
Safety first --- Feeling sick? Stay home! Your research project/the breeding program is not more important than your health or safety. All members of the cucurbit team are expected to follow best practices and reach out if they are unsure about something or need training. 

No heroics --- no one should routinely find themselves in a position where the have to go above and beyond to get their job/task done, this is a hallmark of bad organization, unrealistic goals, lack of work-life balance or some combination thereof. You are not expected to regularly work more than a 40-hour work week. 

Say something --- communication is key! All members of the team will have a one-on-one meeting with myself on a weekly basis. These meetings may be a couple of minutes or longer depending on needs. The goal of these meetings is not for me to judge your productivity---trust you are working to the best of your ability. My goal is to figure out how to best provide support. 

Respect â€“-- there is no hierarchy, everyone will be treated with respect! It goes without saying that any racist, sexist, or other inappropriate comments or behavior will not be tolerated, and I and other employees of the University are **required** to report any conduct covered under Title IX.
